# RNN-AI-Programmer

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are gaining a lot of attention in recent years because it has shown great promise in many natural language processing tasks. Despite their popularity, there are a limited number of tutorials which explain how to implement a simple and interesting application using the state-of-art tools. In this series, we will use a recurrent neural network to train an AI programmer, which can write Java code like a real programmer. The following will be covered:

1. [Building a simple AI programmer using Keras](http://www.programcreek.com/2017/07/recurrent-neural-network-example-ai-programmer-1/) 
2. [Improving the AI programmer - Using tokens](http://www.programcreek.com/2017/07/build-an-ai-programmer-using-recurrent-neural-network-2/)
3. [Improving the AI programmer - Using different network structures](http://www.programcreek.com/2017/07/build-an-ai-programmer-using-recurrent-neural-network-3/)
